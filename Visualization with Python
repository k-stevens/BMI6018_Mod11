#Use the below datasets create any four visualization summarizing the datasets. You can use either Matplotlib, Seaborn or any other python based visualization
#package. Be creative!. Here are some example visualizations: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-graphs-for-data-visualization. Remember to label and
#have legends for your graphs. Add comments to describe what you are trying to graph


#Visualization 1
#This first graph is a bar graph using the breast cancer data provided. It is looking at the frequency of patients with a tumor size in a specific range.
#I thought this would be interesting and good data to know what are more common sizes that tumors are likely to be.
#It's possible we could use this data to see if there's a pattern based on the size of the tumors.
#In order to do this, we have the different tumor size ranges on the x-axis then the number of patients within each range on the y-axis.
#Because it's a single-data bar graph, there is no legend needed, but both the x-axis and y-axis and title are labeled.

breast_cancer = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\kisab\Downloads\breast-cancer.data")


breast_cancer.columns = ['Class','Age','Menopause','Tumor-size','Inv-nodes','Node-caps','Deg-melig','Breast','Breast-quad','Irradiate']

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#breast_cancer.groupby(["Tumor-size"]).count()
#print(breast_cancer)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))

breast_cancer2=breast_cancer.replace('5-9','05-09')

breast_cancer2['Count'] = breast_cancer2.groupby('Tumor-size')['Tumor-size'].transform('count')
breast_cancer2 = breast_cancer2.groupby(['Tumor-size']).size().reset_index().rename(columns={0:'count'})
#breast_cancer2=breast_cancer1.replace('5-9','05-09')

#print(breast_cancer2)

plt.bar(breast_cancer2['Tumor-size'], breast_cancer2['count'])
plt.title('Frequency of Tumor Size')
plt.xlabel('Tumor Size')
plt.ylabel('# of Patients')
plt.show()






# Visualization 2
#This is a pie chart using the breast cancer data provided. It was created to show the distribution of age among the sample.
#I thought it would be beneficial to know the age distribution to see if it's representative of the whole population or to see
#if there's an age range that is more likely to be found to have breast cancer.
#The pie chart is separated by age ranges and the ranges are shown both on the graph and in a legend.
#There is also a title describing it.

breast_cancer = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\kisab\Downloads\breast-cancer.data")


breast_cancer.columns = ['Class','Age','Menopause','Tumor-size','Inv-nodes','Node-caps','Deg-melig','Breast','Breast-quad','Irradiate']

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

breast_cancer['Count2'] = breast_cancer.groupby('Age')['Age'].transform('count')
breast_cancer2 = breast_cancer.groupby(['Age']).size().reset_index().rename(columns={0:'count'})

print(breast_cancer2)
#plot.title('Distribution of Patient Age in Dataset')
breast_cancer2.groupby(['Age']).sum().plot(kind='pie', y='count',title='Distribution of Patient Age in Breast Cancer Dataset')
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.set_size_inches(7,7)






#Visualization 3
#This is a bar chart using the breast cancer data. I wanted to show that I could plot more than just the basic data given,
#so I calculcated the average degree of malignancy for each tumor-size group, then used those results to create a bar chart
#showing what the average degree of malignancy is for every tumor-size group.
#The x-axis is the tumor-size range groups and the y-axis is the average degree of malignancy.
#I thought this would be useful to see if there was a positive correlation between size and degree of malignancy.
#I did not think a legend was needed because both axis and the title are labeled to explain the graph and everything is the same color.

plt.ylabel('Average Degree of Malignancy')
plt.show()








#Visualization 4
#This is a scatter plot using the arrhythmia data provided. I wanted to show a third type of visualization.
#It shows a patient's weight and heartrate compared to other patients.
#The weight is on the x-axis and the heartrate is on the y-axis.
#Each point on the plot represents a different patient.
#I wanted to see if there was a negative correlation between heartrate and age
#I thought that our heartrates slowed as we got older and wanted to test it.
#Because the titles and axes are labeled and single-colored, I did not think a legend was necessary.
